Advanced Python Calculator for Software Engineering Graduate Course
ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This midterm project requires developing an advanced Python-based calculator application that follows professional software development practices.

âœ¨ Key Features & Requirements
âœ” Command-Line Interface (REPL): Users interact with the calculator in real time.
âœ” Design Patterns: Implementation of Command, Facade, Factory, Singleton, and Strategy patterns.
âœ” Comprehensive Logging: Uses logging to track operations, errors, and debug messages dynamically configured via environment variables.
âœ” Calculation History Management: Uses pandas to save, load, and manipulate history.
âœ” Exception Handling: Demonstrates Look Before You Leap (LBYL) and Easier to Ask for Forgiveness than Permission (EAFP).
âœ” Plugin System: Allows dynamic loading of new features.
âœ” 95%+ Test Coverage: All critical functionalities are covered with pytest.
âœ” GitHub Actions CI/CD: Runs tests automatically to ensure stability.
